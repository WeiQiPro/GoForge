Envisioning a Unified SGF Ecosystem

### My Vision: A Singular Nexus for SGF Files
I am building an expansive digital environment dedicated to the management and utilization of SGF (Smart Game Format) files. Here's a snapshot of the features you can anticipate:

#### 1. **Unified SGF Repository**
Status: WIP
A vast and easily navigable space where all your SGF files are organized and retrievable, offering:
   - A panoramic view of your SGF files through a dynamic **graph interface** or a **file management system**.

#### 2. **SGF Manipulation Suite**
Status: WIP
A robust set of tools for comprehensive interaction with SGF files that enables you to:
   - **View**, **edit**, or **create** SGF files with intuitive ease.
   - Conduct **multi-variation comparisons**, enriching your strategic repertoire.

#### 3. **Opening Explorer**
Status: non implemented
An analytical toolset for the strategic examination of game openings that provides:
   - In-depth **comparative analysis** of opening strategies.
   - Statistical insights into your openings to identify and improve upon weaknesses.

#### 4. **FlashCard-Integrated Learning**
Status: non implemented
Harness the proven efficiency of spaced repetition for board game strategy with:
   - A **Anki-deck creation** focused on improving your board position and shape recognition for on the go.

#### 5. **Custom Tsumego Challenges**

A personalized set of problems to refine your problem-solving skills with:
   - An **adaptive tsumego deck** designed to match and challenge your level of expertise.

I invite you to be part of this transformative journey as we redefine strategic gameplay and board game mastery. Keep an eye out for more updates as we inch closer to making this ambitious project a reality.
